title: Do You Love Where You Work?

<b><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Here at Edmunds we not only work really hard, but we play really hard, as well.  </span></b><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><br /></b>We just so happen to have this neat little workplace "policy" called ROWE (Results Only Work Environment), where we get to work wherever we want, whenever we want - so long as we continue to excel on the job. It's just one of the many things that make Edmundsians love working here, aside from a few other small perks, such as its innovation-centric culture, its uber collaborative work environment, and its monthly massage &amp; weekly meditation sessions, and did I mention its in-house movie &amp; sporting event viewings and subsidized health &amp; gym memberships? But don't take my word for it. Edmunds was recently featured by CyberCoders.com in Ritika Trikha's article, "5 Ways to Create a More Positive Culture". </span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Extra!
