Ben, here.  I just thought I'd write a quick post about refreshing a tech blog.

There's a lot of stuff to think about.  First, you have to think about the framework.  I decided to go with github pages for a number of reasons.

- It is a static site (no need for databases)
- I get templating through Jekyll
- Easily customizable in code (not through plugins or widgets)
- It's hosted for free by github
- You can write posts in markdown or plain old html
- It's the ["best way to nerd out"](http://thenextweb.com/businessapps/2015/05/11/the-18-best-blogging-and-publishing-platforms-on-the-internet-today/11/)
